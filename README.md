# Text Editor
This text editor implements *all the basic functions of text editors*. This function is made in the right functional menu.
The left menu contains functions for saving, opening and creating new files, as well as a button for changing styles (by clicking on which a window with possible editor styles will be opened).
There is also the possibility of inserting images. Which in the future will be improved.
Appearance of the main window:
